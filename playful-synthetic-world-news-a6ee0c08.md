# Playful Synthetic World News

A fanciful, non-factual roundup of whimsical headlines from a parallel, make-believe today.

## Front Page, From a Parallel Timeline

Welcome to the make-believe edition where nothing is verified, everything is invented, and reality has the day off.

- Global clocks call a recess; time doodles in the margins and forgets to ring the bell.
- A city of umbrellas opens downtown, offering shade during sun-showers and applause during rainbow encores.
- Stock tickers retire in favor of stickers; portfolios now sparkle with holographic confetti.
- Diplomats fold a peace treaty out of paper cranes; it flutters, yet somehow stays together.
- Scientists bottle a brand-new color and label it “Wednesday,” despite protests from Thursday.

All reports above are 100% pretend, cooked gently over a low whimsy.

## Weather, Whether, Whither

Forecast: 80% chance of plot twists with scattered aha-moments. Fog banks made of daydreams drifting north-northeast, followed by a late evening of meteor showers that RSVP with glitter pens.

## Markets of Make-Believe

Imaginary indices point mostly sideways while optimism wears roller skates. Bears knit sweaters for bulls; bulls compliment the stitch work. Currency exchange rates measured in high-fives per minute.

## Sports (and Sorts)

The international hide-and-seek championship remains in progress, chiefly because the reigning champion is spectacular at not being here right now. Meanwhile, marathoners complete a lap around a very enthusiastic metaphor.

## Tiny Headlines

- Libraries announce late fees can be paid in well-told jokes.
- Trains learn to hum in harmony with their tracks.
- Breakfast cereals release a limited edition flavor called “Victory at 7:12 AM.”
- A committee of houseplants drafts a bill recognizing sunlight as a friend.
